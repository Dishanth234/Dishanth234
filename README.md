## About
I’m a cybersecurity graduate student with a strong focus on **cloud security architecture, application security, and detection engineering**.

My work centers on identifying **cloud misconfigurations**, performing **risk and threat assessments**, and translating security findings into **actionable detection and remediation strategies**. I have hands-on experience aligning security controls with **MITRE ATT&CK**, **CIS Benchmarks**, and regulatory frameworks, with the goal of reducing **mean time to detect (MTTD)** and **mean time to respond (MTTR)**.

<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### ☁️ Cloud & Application Security
- Secure cloud architecture and misconfiguration analysis  
- Identity and access control (IAM, least privilege, MFA)  
- Serverless security (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)  
- Data protection: encryption, key management, secure APIs  
- Edge and application hardening (WAF, CloudFront)  
- Security logging, monitoring, and alerting pipelines  

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🛡️ Detection, Risk & Operations
- Threat modeling and attack-path analysis  
- Cloud and application risk assessments  
- Detection engineering aligned to attacker behavior  
- Incident response workflows and alert triage  
- SIEM-based analysis (Splunk, Elastic)  
- Network traffic visibility and investigation
